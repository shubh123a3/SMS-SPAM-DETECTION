# SMS Spam Classifier

This project utilizes Python, Streamlit, NLTK, and machine learning techniques to create a web application that classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam. The application uses a pre-trained model and a TF-IDF vectorizer to analyze the text of SMS messages.

## Features
The SMS Spam Classifier project features a Python-based web application that leverages Streamlit, NLTK, and machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam. Here are its key features:

- **Spam Detection**: Utilizes a machine learning model to accurately classify SMS messages into spam or not spam categories.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface, making it easy for users to interact with the application. Users can input SMS messages and receive instant classification results.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Implements several text preprocessing steps to prepare SMS messages for classification. These steps include converting text to lowercase, tokenization (splitting text into individual words or tokens), removing non-alphanumeric characters, excluding stopwords (common words that are usually ignored in text processing) and punctuation, and stemming (reducing words to their root form).
- **Machine Learning Model**: The application uses a pre-trained model along with a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer to analyze and classify the text of SMS messages. The TF-IDF vectorizer converts text data into a format that is suitable for model training and prediction.
- **Easy Setup and Installation**: The project includes detailed instructions for setting up and running the application, including steps for cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, activating the virtual environment, and installing required dependencies.

This project aims to provide an effective solution for detecting spam messages, offering both technical and non-technical users a simple way to classify SMS messages through a web interface.
- **Spam Detection**: Classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes lowercasing, tokenization, removing non-alphanumeric characters, excluding stopwords and punctuation, and stemming.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   [git clone <repository-url>](https://github.com/shubh123a3/SMS-SPAM-DETECTION.git)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the project, you can run the Streamlit application using the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit in your web browser to use the application. Enter an SMS message into the text area and click the "predict" button to classify the message as spam or not spam.
